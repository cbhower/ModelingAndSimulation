    "Traffic has a major impact on the quality of peopleâ€™s lives. It is always frustrating to be stuck in stop and go traffic but it is especially frustrating when there is seemingly no need for the traffic. The phenomenon of stop and go traffic that occurs when there is sufficient roadway to handle the volume of cars at a given time is called bottleneck free traffic. This has been studied experimentally via placing actuals drivers on a circular track. It has been shown that simple fluctuations in accelerating and braking can be sufficient to cause the wave behavior observed in real traffic conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project recreates the dynamics of bottleneck free traffic using an agent-based simulation. The agents move in a loop and the next position of the agent is evaluated locally. Each agent tries to move at some constant speed in order to prevent traffic build up on the track. There are (2) behaviors that model different driving assumptions: 'Constant', which models a perfect driver that always moves the target distance at each time interval that the all agents are trying to move. This type of agent could be a good model for autonomous vehicles. 'Constant random' is the second behavior which models imperfect distances travelled at each time interval via sampling from a gaussian distribution. When the mix argument is set to False, all agents are Human agents. When the mix argument is set to True, the population is approximately 50/50 humans and autonomous vehicles.\n"

    "Congestion and pile ups can be seen in with the constant target behavior that characterizes human drivers. Although the agents start uniformly distributed on the track, traffic conditions appear after only a few time steps. A key feature of traffic jams is the oscillating pattern that looks something like peristalsis. This is difficult to quantify but qualitatively, there does seem to be some similarity in the results of the simulation. Congestion builds up and often persists for multiple time steps. "
